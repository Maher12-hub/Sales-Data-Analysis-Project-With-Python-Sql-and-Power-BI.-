# üßæ Sales Data Analysis with Python, SQL & Power BI

##  Project Objective
This project analyzes Company‚Äôs sales data (2014‚Äì2018) to uncover key revenue and profit drivers across **products, sales channels, and regions**. The goal is to identify:
- Seasonal trends and outliers  
- Regional and product-level performance  
- Budget alignment and profitability  
- Opportunities for pricing, promotion, and market optimization  

By integrating **Python (EDA)**, **SQL (data extraction)**, and **Power BI (visualization)**, this end-to-end analysis provides actionable insights for data-driven business decisions.

##  Key Business Questions / KPIs
1. **Total Revenue & Profit:** What is the company‚Äôs overall performance across years?  
2. **Regional Performance:** Which regions contribute the most to sales and profitability?  
3. **Product Analysis:** Which product categories or individual products drive the most profit?  
4. **Sales Channels:** How do online and offline sales channels compare in performance?  
5. **Customer Behavior:** Are there seasonal or trend-based fluctuations in sales?  
6. **Budget vs Actual:** How closely do actuals align with planned sales targets?

##  Process Overview

### 1. Data Extraction (SQL)
- Queried the company‚Äôs sales database to extract tables including *Orders, Customers, Products, and Regions*.
- Performed joins and aggregations to prepare a structured dataset for analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Wrangling (Python)
- Handled missing values, inconsistent data types, and outlier records.
- Standardized date formats and calculated derived fields like *Profit, *Profit Margin and *Revenue Per Order*.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Used **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to identify correlations and visualize key metrics.
- Analyzed sales distribution, seasonal trends, and profitability by region and product.
- Feature engineering: Created ‚ÄúQuarter,‚Äù ‚ÄúMonth,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRegion Category‚Äù features to enrich the dataset.

### 4. Visualization & Insights (Power BI)
- Built an interactive **Sales Dashboard** to explore KPIs dynamically.
- Included slicers for year, Month, States and Channel category filters.
- Created visuals for:
  - Revenue & profit trends (line charts)
  - Top-performing products (bar chart)
  - Regional comparison (map visualization)
  - Profit margin distribution (card & KPI visuals)

##  Project Insights
- **Top Regions:** West and Midwest regions led revenue and Profit generation, contributing over 60% of total sales.  
- **High-Profit Products:** Premium and electronics categories delivered the highest margins.  
- **Seasonality:** Strong sales spikes during **Q2**, indicating strong holiday season performance.  
- **Underperforming Regions:** Certain emerging markets had low profitability due to high discounts.  
- **Sales Channels:** Wholesale Sales showed higher year-over-year growth compared.  
- **Budget Gaps:** Minor deviations between actual and forecasted revenue in FY2018 indicated effective planning.
